# NYC_MTA_EDA_Project
 
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on MTA turnstile data using SQL and Python, generate actionable, revenue-generating insights for a hypothetical business, and present that information in clear and concise manner using Python visualization libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). As a further goal, I'd like to compare this information with neighborhood demographic information broken down by NYC neighborhood. 

Question/need:

My plan is to analyze the MTA turnstile data for the calendar year 2021. The insights I'm going to be pulling from this data will primarily be focused on identifying the volume of foot traffic (broken down into entries/exits) moving through a given subway station in NYC, on a given day, at a given time. By aligning this data with data pulled from the 2020 Census, I believe we can generate some compelling insights about the quantity and demographics of the foot traffic moving through all of NYC's subway stations during the calendar year 2021.

In terms of who stands to benefit from these insights, I believe they would be most applicable to a digital signage business looking to launch a pilot program in NYC's subway stations. Not only would the information help them understand where the highest volume of traffic is (and thus the best stations to install signage), but also the dates and times during which traffic is highest, and the prevailing demographics of a given station's neighborhood. This will help them price adspace appropriately for their customers.


Data Description:
What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
We will be using MTA Turnstile data, taken from http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html and organized into a SQLite Database locally. We will also be using Census data
What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
Tools:
How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
MVP Goal:
What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
